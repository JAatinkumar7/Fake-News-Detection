# Fake-News-Detection
This is a Machine learning project based on Detection of news as fake or Real.
I’ll explain several ways to detect fake news using collected data from different articles. But the same techniques can be applied to different scenarios.

For the coders and experts, I’ll explain the Python code to load, clean, and analyze data. Then we will do some machine learning models to perform a classification task (fake or not)
The data comes from Kaggle, you can download it here:

Fake and real news dataset
